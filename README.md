## File description
* The "/data" folder contains the raw data used in the analyses as well as their outputs
* The "/func" folder contains custom made functions used in the analyses
* The "/graph" folder contains the files necessary to create maps etc., as well as other graphical outputs
* The "/LaTeX" folder contains the files used to compile the manuscript

## 2017/02/13
